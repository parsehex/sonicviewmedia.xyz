[{"content":" Introduction\nSequel time already, huh?\nI was actually very excited to read Mythics 2. I’ve been picking things apart for both official review and my own improvement for quite awhile. But this is the very first time in my life that one of my criticisms has reached the creators to possibly influence later work. Upon an initial skim through the comic while I was multitasking, I was thrilled. It was immediately obvious that all of my art critiques landed. I was looking forward to seeing if the same was true for the writing.\nUnfortunately… I’m reminded of a quote from Jurassic Park 2.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n“Don’t worry, I’m not making the same mistakes again.”\n“No, you’re making all new ones.”\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDISCLAIMER: Since my reviews of the original Mythoverse releases a year ago, I’ve made decent friends with a lot of the creators and then some. You know, we’re not talking every night but we interact online often. I should also disclose that some have come directly to me for advice since my reviews. Despite my admittedly growing bias towards the series and its creators, I still have absolutely no intention of allowing it to affect my review. As usual, it’ll be strictly about the abject quality of the work. I won’t be boring you all with my “super cool” insider perspective, that’s what investigative articles are for. Reviews are meant to be made so that you know if you should spend money or not.\nExcept now, this is my website. I can make this as long as I need without worry. So let’s start with a recap, shall we?\nFor those of you who don’t want to or don’t have time to go back and read my review of Mythics: I basically said it was bad in literally every way and you shouldn’t even consider buying it, in the nicest way I possibly could.\nLet me be clear from the outset: I do not feel that Mythics 2 is nearly as poor quality as the series’ initial outing. There is notable improvement across the board here. The issue lies in where. Quite literally all of it seems to harkon back to critiques myself or others made. Which is not nothing mind you, the ability to take a harsh critique in stride and address it directly is invaluable. But if you only rely on others’ feedback to improve, you’ll find yourself making all new mistakes.\n=======================================================\nWriting\nFor example: I actually know what’s happening in Mythics 2. But unfortunately, it’s because Matt (the writer) seems to have shifted from explaining absolutely nothing, to explaining absolutely everything. “Vaguely communicating information” is one of the two things I ever mentioned that wasn’t completely addressed in Mythics 2.\nNow we have the opposite problem: Characters telling and not showing. Sometimes it’s not even worked into conversation. A character will just be thinking about what their stuff does and how it works, for some reason. Or another character might straight up call out what someone’s feeling even though said feeling was perfectly communicated by the artwork and a vague narration comment in the previous panel.\nOn the back of that, we have another strange issue with the narration boxes. Simply put: They’re used interchangeably with dialogue bubbles. Granted the characters are out of view whenever this is done. But that still leaves the reader with essentially nothing but context to figure out that this particular narration box is actually meant to be vocal speech. These also need to be differentiated. I understand trying to fit characters into every frame they’re speaking in is unrealistic. But we need a way to know that the thing we’re looking at is speech and not thought at a glance.\nBefore it was unclear who’s narration we were looking at. That’s been addressed, they’re now color coded and introduced properly. But now we have the very new problem of those boxes not being identifiable at all from a completely different type of dialogue.\nIt’s admittedly a delicate balance. “When should we say something, when shouldn’t we? Should we really have four dozen different types of text boxes for any occasion?” Thankfully, the answer to these questions is often found by answering much simpler ones: “Can this confound my audience? If so, is that my intent?”\nIf a little vagueness isn’t bound to completely lose people, all but the hopelessly clueless will gather what’s going on, then things don’t need to be explained further. If a certain someone is libel to dehumanize a character in their mind simply because of the dehumanizing circumstances they were brought up in, then maybe that’s the very kind of person your story is meant to expose, and you shouldn’t worry too much about what they might think.\nThese are questions I have to ask myself when writing all the time. Specifically, that latter bit was in reference to my current work (at the time of this review). When I asked myself whether or not I should be making a “so obvious it hurts” hint about the cloned nature of the protagonist to make it clear to my audience that is indeed a thing, all I had to do was ask myself if all of the previous much more subtle hints already did that job. I cut it immediately. When a friend posed the concern that their numbered name on top of their “manufactured in a tube” origin might make them less relatable to some, my response was, “Those people probably aren’t gonna get much out of the story anyway.”\nIt is my intent to make my audience think about the implications of what’s happening. A few little hints as to the origins of the character and their lot in life is enough to get the ball rolling on that. I don’t need to baby talk people who intend to read a genre where complex worldbuilding and philosophy are practically mandatory. And I do not need to pander to those that would dehumanize someone like that just to call out that very selfish behavior.\nIf you’re writing a hot and heavy romance story and you don’t describe just how unreasonably attractive the love interest is at every given chance, the audience is probably gonna be a little disappointed. If you explain absolutely every little detail in every moment to an audience that wants to read about magical secret societies and conspiracies, they’re probably gonna feel a little insulted.\nI’m not gonna pretend it’s easy to always know the best answer for any given situation. Sometimes you’ll be completely caught off guard as to what might confuse a reader. But when you’re doing things like using narration boxes for speech, or having a character completely explain information that was already communicated in just the previous panel, I have to wonder if you’re asking yourself these questions at all. That one example was hardly the only instance. Don’t just put something out and wait for the critique to tell you what was wrong. Question yourself. Hell, question the critique. Ask yourself if it makes sense.\nYou can imply information. You don’t need to withhold it, and you don’t necessarily need to explain it either. Say for example you have a character preparing for a situation. If you show exactly what precautions they’re taking, the reader can easily infer things about the character’s background. They don’t even necessarily need to explain the logic of said actions, as that should be evident now if not later. The way they explain things might give it away, or how they approach it. The mere act itself implies either experience or forethought, often both. The way they actually deal with that situation can imply strategy, the behavior or attributes of what they’re dealing with.\nIt’s important to have a tight grasp on the rules of your world so that you can do things like that. Information can be inferred by the reader based on the consistent details they’re seeing. That’s why people like hard magic systems. Not because they necessarily want every single little rule explained to them, but because it keeps things consistent when you’re writing. The actions of the characters make sense based on what you see them dealing with. Because it would be really unfortunate if you just got done explaining a rule, and then immediately show your character doing something that is excessively risky based on those rules which in turn makes them look incompetent. Yeah we’re on to the next writing issue.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI was gonna wait to show this in the art portion, but I quickly realized it wouldn’t hold much weight aside from asking, “Why did her hoodie change pattern and color from page to page?” Now, I think I know why. I think she turned it inside out. But first of all that’s the quickest “remove hoodie, turn it inside out, put it back on” I have ever seen. It also wasn’t communicated very well. Or at all, really. It also makes me wonder why she wouldn’t already have it turned inside out instead of waiting for shit to go South.\nNow you on the other hand might be wondering why in the hell she would turn it inside out at all. That’s because as a previous scene very clearly explained: Spriggans (the monster they’re dealing with in this issue) have a weird magical weakness that makes you invisible if you turn your clothes inside out. Dumb, fun, they poke at it themselves. But I’m sure you can already start to see why this hoodie thing might bug me.\nI’ve said it before, I’ll say it again: I don’t much care about sexualizing characters. I grew up with Mortal Kombat and loved that shit. I would start to feel like a dumb SJW for doing this twice in a row in most cases. But in Metal Gear Solid V, where a female character is wearing one of the dumbest outfits I have ever seen, there is still a point made about why she needs to be wearing next to nothing. In Mythics, it is equally as clearly explained why this character should be covered more than a nun on Sunday morning.\nThis is a problem you created. I wouldn’t have even noticed if it wasn’t just explained to me why this shouldn’t be a thing. I don’t care if she’s wearing spriggan proof nipple pasties, as long as it’s justified. In Mythics however, we are very clearly told that this trick only works if at least 50% of your body is covered. So why in the thot simping fuck would you choose to cover only half of your body in one of the loosest articles of clothing you can possibly get your hands on?\nDid I mention she’s supposed to be afraid of these things? You should be dressed like a prodestant gimp ma’am. A body suit with enough zippers and clamps to lock down a government black site. You are going into a situation with a creature that was at the heart of a traumatic experience, and you have a golden ticket to make it harmless. You do not want that shit coming off. Or jostling up and down making you repeatedly visible when you move like at all.\nThat is four hundred and sixty words about why that outfit is just… dumb. And I haven’t even mentioned the fact that she’s running across a sandy beach. You see that gremlin dude in the bottom right? That’s a spriggan. He can’t see her. He can’t see the footsteps of a woman running through the sand in flip-flops. So everything people using this trick interact with is also invisible? Is the earth itself invisible to him? Do you see why consistent, well thought out rules are necessary?\nConsistency is key. If there is no consistency, the reader is left to assume the writer is just making things up as they go along. A lack of consistency makes the reader wonder why they should get invested at all. If the writer doesn’t care enough to take their own established rules into account, why should the reader care to learn about them?\n=======================================================\nArt\nThis lack of consistency is not unique to the writing of Mythics I’m afraid. It also affects the art. Yes, just like the writing basically everything I pointed out in my review of the first issue was addressed in the artwork. Unfortunately Beth (the artist) too, makes all new mistakes that I just wouldn’t be doing my job right if I didn’t point out.\nI’d like to acknowledge the positives first. It was immediately apparent that small fundamental issues like the face shapes of the female characters has been fixed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBeth even gave Elthia the original shape, seems almost like a nod to the first Mythics. But yeah, I don’t think I’ve seen one “same face” in this. Even Galatyn got a small redesign, looks good.\nHer color work is also still very good. Though I’ve now noticed an unfortunate trend with that: It only seems to be the case specifically in outdoor scenes at night. Daytime, inside, rather bland. Especially indoors. In fact, many of the indoor backgrounds seem… unfinished.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe bland pallet aside… Why are there blank tapestries on the walls? Why would you bother putting them there if you’re not even gonna put a simple design on them? I get redrawing the same intricate design every time is a panel continuity nightmare, but you can at least do something simple with colors and shapes. Why put them there at all if you’re not? And this panel actually has the best indoor background in the entire comic.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere are little mistakes like this all over the place (there’s even one I didn’t circle in this image). Now they’re understandable, I make them too. But they wouldn’t have been missed if even a single person reviewed the comic. I caught every single one of these on my second look through.\nHonestly stuff like this gives the impression that production on Mythics 2 was extremely rushed. But unfortunately, it doesn’t quite stop there.\nBefore I move on, I’d like to explain myself a bit. Last time I kinda dug into my own art when picking apart the art of Mythics. But unlike last time, I feel like the issues are fairly obvious. It’s not something subtle and fundamental that needs to be explained. For example: The reason Elthia’s torso is transparent is because Beth simply forgot to put a foundation color underneath the material texture. It happens. What surprises me is how many of these little obvious mistakes made it to print. Did no one look over this?\nI saved the worst for last though. This one… this one baffles me a lot more than the simple mistakes above.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNow I’ll understand if it takes you a moment to figure this one out. Took a minute for me to really notice. The irony is, the only reason I did was because I was drawn in for a closer look by the nice color work. If you still haven’t noticed, I’d recommend opening the image in a new tab, and zooming in on the city and trees.\nThat’s right, they’re all stock PNG’s you could find on Google Images. What’s worse, they’re not even lawyered or colored properly. And for some reason Beth also used a pixelated texture on the beach? I… cannot fathom why this is in the comic.\nThis isn’t the only time these tricks are used, but it’s by far the worst instance. And it’s used so seldom, it makes these panels really stick out. When most of your comic has this nice flowing linework with pastels, it’s really noticeable when your cityscape is made up of floating power line PNG’s.\nIt’s made all the worse by a later panel that has a city backdrop, except it’s actually drawn.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMessy and archaic? Yes, but that fits with the rest of the comic’s style. The first one looks like a concept mockup for what would eventually become the second. But these panels are six pages apart in the same comic.\nSimple graphic design tricks can be used to great effect. I don’t have an issue with them being used in a comic. The problem is the frankly blatantly unfinished execution. How did that happen? There’s no way you didn’t know that wasn’t finished. I noticed the first time I squinted my eyes at it. The inconsistency of its use is part of the problem. If you’re only going to use it on three out of the twenty three pages you work on, why use it at all?\nThose panels don’t even have the same type of trees.\nI showed this to a friend of mine while I was working on the review. No context, no well poisoning. I sent both images to them. What they said I thought was poignant.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n“It seems like they don’t care enough about what product they put out.”\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThat is the impression these muck ups give your audience. The first time someone sees it, they think you don’t care. They think you’re just shoving some product out the door for the sake of it.\n=======================================================\nConclusion\nThere are mistakes like that all over. From typos, to sentences that just don’t make sense. Colors missing, lines bursting through panels. Things that would’ve been caught in a once over by any editor. Do you even do your own editing? I genuinely have to wonder. I don’t understand how any of these issues make it to print if you weren’t rushed in production.\nI make a point of keeping my “insider perspective” out of reviews for a couple of reasons. First of all it’s just not relevant most of the time. Second of all, I figure it’ll make any readers feel like I’m trying to sell (or prevent sales of) some product I have a personal connection to. But this is one instance I genuinely feel I’d be doing people a disservice if I didn’t mention it.\nI know they weren’t rushed. In fact, I’m fairly certain they had extra time. How on earth does a project that had extra time, feel rushed?\nThere are a bunch of little things I just didn’t specifically point out in this review, as that would needlessly bloat it. As I said, they’re all fairly obvious. But there is one more thing that I need to talk about specifically, and I’m putting it here because I honestly don’t know if I should call it an “art” or “writing” issue. All I know is: Someone, somewhere, did not get a fuckin’ memo.\nA scene at the very end of the comic shows the main character lamenting their lack of action in an earlier scene. She felt guilty that she didn’t act, that she “froze” in a situation where she was needed. The problem is, that moment was the hoodie scene. The one where she apparently moved so quickly, she could goddamn Superman her garment inside out and was already bolting towards her foe by the time we laid eyes on her again. That is apparently the moment when she “froze”, the moment when she locked her opponent by the neck against a tree.\nThe witch only escaped because she actually had a backup plan for fuck’s sake, what do you mean you “froze”? Again, another problem that any single person can spot on their first time reading. I know I did. How did this make it to the final version? How did it even happen to begin with? They’re two contradicting events!\nThis is basic stuff guys, and it’s not nearly as complex or nuanced as something like “character design” or “setting up narration boxes”. This is one thing happening, and the characters talking about a completely different chain of events like that happened instead. A character locking up in the presence of a mythical creature at the center of a traumatic experience isn’t even a bad idea for a story, it’s just not what happened!\nI think… I think I see now, why I’ve heard some people say they feel this is worse than the first entry of Mythics. I’m still not sure I agree with that (basic comprehension of the plot certainly helps), but I get it.\nI hate doing this again, honestly. On a personal level, these kats took the last review really well. I still felt a little bad about it basically all the way up until reading Mythics 2. Now, I can’t say that I do anymore. There are just too many things in here that shouldn't have made it into the final product. They’re not first-timer fumbles with the fundamentals either. They’re problems that anyone can see.\nI should not be your worst critic. You should be. You need to look at your own work harshly, because most people aren’t gonna try to be nice and unbiased about it. If you are not constantly critical of your own work, mistakes like this will always be common. It can be done without making it an unhealthy habit. You just have to think critically and objectively about your own work.\nNo matter how bad I want to, I cannot in good faith recommend people buy Mythics 2. There’s just too much wrong here. I wouldn’t have allowed it to release if it was my own work.\nIt’s disappointing, honestly. I really was excited.\n","date":"2021-03-09","id":0,"permalink":"/blog/mythics-2/","summary":"Introduction\nSequel time already, huh?\nI was actually very excited to read Mythics 2.

This is the first time I’ve had the chance to do a followup to one of my comic reviews. While I had access to both issues, I didn’t actually read the second issue until after I reviewed the first. So my thoughts on it were entirely unfiltered and focused on that one alone. It’s an interesting thing to see where the series went next after detailing all of my feelings on the first. You know when you’re sitting down watching a show or something normally, you’re not writing a full critique after every episode. So you don’t have an in depth analysis of everything it did right and wrong to compare with when you reach the next episode. It’s a unique perspective, to say the least.\nI’ll be writing this review as if you’ve read my review of issue one, so check that out if you haven’t already.\nI was very pleasantly surprised by this one. At first I was worried it was gonna repeat the mistake that caused my only real problem with the first issue. But not only did it turn out to be even longer (thus allowing for more time), but the creators somehow managed to keep everything that they did right the first time around, and add everything it lacked.\nThe fun “storyteller” presentation is still intact (which is what initially had me worried it was gonna be more of the same), but it delves into much more recent events as well. So this time we actually get to see the world and how Jack interacts with it. We finally understand what kind of character he is and how those past experiences have shaped him. We also get a lot more information about how the world works.\nWith so much time now being spent with Jack and other characters we know are currently around and affecting the world, there’s a lot more for the audience to latch on to. The first issue had the problem of basically every character you’re introduced to ending up dead often times on the very same page (even Jack himself in that life). This time we not only get to see those important past events, but also the people they influence now.\nHonestly, the turn around from one issue to another was incredible. That’s why I’m coming up a bit short when it comes to the length of this one. Basically every problem was addressed. That, and the fact that about half of the aspects I’d cover in this sort of article were tackled in the last. I mean the art is still just as good, and the writing has only gotten better. Kinda makes me question the approach of reviewing these individually when I have access to more than one.\nI can basically recommend Jack Irons without a single caveat now. There’s no reason not to check this out if you’re interested in the setting and story. It’s well made with creators that heed criticism. Many things have been expertly set up, and I can’t wait to see where they go.\nI’m gonna give Jack Irons a definite “buy” recommendation. And with the Indiegogo for issue three coming in February, you can support the series going forward if you like it. Check it out, it’s a great read with wonderful art.\n","date":"2021-02-20","id":1,"permalink":"/blog/jack-irons-issue-2/","summary":"(DISCLAIMER: This is an archived article from my time at the gaming/pop-culture website “Escape Zero”.

All articles with this disclaimer were written in the latter third of 2019.)\nI find immortal characters incredibly interesting. From Wolverine in the X-Men, to Highlander, and just about any vampire story. That’s why I have some of my own. Either immortal, or just characters of a fantasy race that live longer than humans. The people and ages they see, the role they play throughout a world’s history. The endless potential for a full range of emotion and new experiences. Despite the overpowered nature that may make a character immortal, it’s made up for in an abundance of intrigue.\nJack Irons has an interesting approach to the immortal character. Rather than being a powerful mutant or an everlasting creature of the night, the titular character actually reincarnates and retains the memories of his past lives (though there does seem to be a little “extended lifespan” thrown in there too).\nAn immortal character, and a sci-fi with a western edge. Basically, it’d be an uphill battle to ruin this one for me. I’m gonna be upfront, I liked this one a lot. I can’t really find much to fault that couldn’t be considered nitpicking. As a reviewer, you’ve failed your job if you suggest something is near perfect without thoroughly explaining why. And as a writer, “it was good” as feedback is just as useless as “it was bad”. If you’re going to praise something, the best thing you can do for the creators and your viewers, is to tell them why it was so good. That way the creators know what their strengths are, and the consumer knows if they should be interested.\nIf I were to do my best to pick out what Jack Irons’ biggest flaw is, I’d say it’s the fact that essentially the entire first issue is exposition. Personally it doesn’t bother me, but I know it is an issue for many. I thought Jack’s explanation of his past was well paced and presented. It set up a lot about the character. Only real issue is, the world’s introduction suffered for it. It was teased, but this would’ve been a much bigger problem if there wasn’t already a second issue of the series available.\nSo why did I enjoy Jack Irons so much despite this? Let’s get into it.\nFirst of all, the art is just fantastic. It’s heavily stylized, and memorable. I really like how Maximiliano Dall’o plays with proportions to make his character designs stand out. You can tell he’s using the sci-fi setting as an excuse to go nuts with it, and I’m loving it. Just look at how many completely unique silhouettes there are in the background characters alone.\nThat’s not to discount the color work by Matias Laborde. The way it glows and shines is a pleasure to look at.\nOne distinct advantage to the first issue being so exposition heavy, is that you get to know the character fairly well. There’s a sort of humbleness to him as a result of his wisdom, it gives you an immediate respect for Jack. The exploration of his past and his current description of it gives you a great read of his personality. Unfortunately, the lack of anything going on during the time of the story means you don’t really know what he does or what drives him currently.\nWe do get a short little fight at the end that gives us a good impression of how he carries himself, but that’s about it. The only other information this encounter provides is that Jack is apparently a very wanted man, and he himself only makes passing comments about the fact that there are quite a few reasons for it.\nSo, I suppose the problem isn’t really with the exposition itself, just that it’s so heavily top loaded. It’s not that there’s anything wrong with the execution, just that the audience will likely feel like they’re forced to sit through a long winded history lesson before they’re allowed to watch the World War II film. Things like this are better dispersed throughout a story, being brought up at relevant times. Jack revealing this information during an exciting adventure may have even had some comedic potential, if that’s ever something you need.\nIt feels as if we’re being treated to the anecdote of a legendary character, without being aware of why we should care.\nThe more I get into this, the more I realize I actually do take issue with the way it played out. I suppose that’s just proof to my earlier notion that I do have a bit of a bias towards the subject matter, I almost didn’t even notice I had a problem with any of it. I can’t even fault it for length, as it was a fairly sized comic. The backstory simply takes up that much of the time.\nSo that’s about the long and short of it. It’s problems may have been a lot more severe had there not already been a release of the second issue before this review was written. It’s good, and has a great style. But the first issue of Jack Irons is more of a prologue than a story arc, and you should be aware of that before deciding to purchase it.\nI personally recommend it, but I would also recommend the creators perhaps come up with some way to package the first two issues together, lest customers feel just a bit cheated. That being said though there is that second issue, so if you like where this is going you can absolutely get more.\nWith that, I’ll see you in the review for Jack Irons #2.\n","date":"2021-02-20","id":2,"permalink":"/blog/jack-irons-issue-1/","summary":"(DISCLAIMER: This is an archived article from my time at the gaming/pop-culture website “Escape Zero”.

All articles with this disclaimer were written in the latter third of 2019.)\nIf you the reader have seen my other reviews, you’re probably aware that I love noir. It evokes a certain image in your mind when you see the word, but it’s such a versatile genre that your imagination is likely only scratching the surface. Your thoughts likely turn to cyberpunk or 1940’s settings. In reality, it only describes a set of circumstances that can be placed literally anywhere. From fantasy to superhero stories. Today’s topic goes with the traditional 40’s, but that’s not to say it’s without its own clever subversions.\nFull disclosure: Dogs and Sailors was sent to me by the writer themselves for review. Along with that, I was informed of a planned reboot and redesign of the comic. I was given scant details on what exactly will be changed, but we’ll be talking about this as if I don’t know any of it. After all, the purpose of a review is to evaluate the available product, not what it may become. So if I have any comments that entail what I heard, I’ll likely save them for the end.\nAs usual, I’ll start with the shortest subject first. In this case: The art. In some moderately noticeable ways, the illustrations are somewhat… Inexperienced. The occasional lackluster composition, or nonsensical proportion of small details (even considering the stylistic approach). The most glaring of which I can think of, is an instance where a character seems to turn in the wrong direction to face another person.\nThat being said, I find the style and presentation so fun and absolutely refreshing, that these issues barely bothered me. Obviously the art is meant to imitate that of crime pulp of the time, some may even recognize it as the style of things like Archie. However, there’s a thick obvious line between actively choosing an outdated popular style to suit your work, and following the trends of today. I adore what they’re going for here, it actually manages to perfectly compliment some things I really enjoyed about the writing.\nI think that’s probably the smoothest transition I’ve ever made. I actually really liked the writing in this one. There’s a lot I want to talk about, and I’m not entirely certain where to start. Dogs and Sailors presents itself like an actual crime comic of the time, it’s played completely straight. You might think that’d be overly cheesy, or hard to take seriously. But Forester (the writer) knows just when to hold back, and allow a heavy moment to take place. Or rather, since it’s being presented so earnestly, it doesn’t feel like a switch has suddenly been hit. What’s happening is dark, no matter the climate of culture at any given time. So when something serious happens, the playful recollection doesn’t need to grind to a halt to allow it. The fun presentation persists, and gruesome moments are given the weight they need. It all flows together nicely.\nThat being said, Forester smartly avoids elements that would be presented in a silly manner (by our current standards) when these things are happening. It’s an extremely delicate balance the writer has managed to strike, it’s frankly impressive. From “a crazy reefer with a knife”, to horrible mutilation. All of these things exist in the same story without feeling inconsistent.\nOne of the few requirements of “noir” is that it features hard-boiled, cynical characters. Dogs and Sailors does something I find incredibly interesting: It’s main character becomes that way over the course of the story, rather than beginning as such. He starts out kind, dutiful, almost naive. But as he’s exposed to the brutality of his current case, he begins losing sight of what he once considered his values. The creators even went as far as having the character wear a “Superman” pin, to more subtly hint at his ideals of justice and good. I think allowing the audience to watch this character’s decline into the genre requirement was a really intriguing idea. It has the bonus of giving people much more emotional investment, they have something to compare him to when he hits that low point in his life. Like watching a friend you care for slowly spiral into a state of despair.\nMy largest complaint about the writing is that the mystery is… Well, it’s not much of a mystery at all. There’s a surprisingly fine art to writing a detective story like this. It’s not all bad, Forester has the basics down pat. Instead of revealing far too much with some kind of overblown intro (lookin’ at you modern Law \u0026 Order), the writer ties the audience more or less to the perspective of the characters conducting the investigation. The issue lies in just how quickly and thoroughly the crime is uncovered. Some of this may be due entirely to time constraints, it’s not a horribly long comic. It needs to either be longer, or you need to be willing to draw plots out over multiple issues.\nThe investigation side of the plot is what I was the least invested in. Which is saying something, since I love that sort of thing enough to be writing my own noir story, and am working towards getting licensed so that I can work as a PI again. Or maybe that just makes me overly critical? I suppose it’s certainly possible.\nThat being said, I think I can make some recommendations to improve this aspect in a way that shouldn’t leave anyone hanging. People like myself that go a little overboard love these stories, but so do a lot of people that aren’t looking to pick apart an intricate mystery on their own. Unlike many situations, I believe there’s actually a way to appease both crowds here. Leave some little hints throughout the story, details that will allow the attentive audience member to piece together the mystery themselves. It could be something in the background that the characters didn’t quite notice, or maybe something they took note of but didn’t understand it’s implications. Allow for a good bit of time before the puzzle is really solved by the characters (this will have the bonus of making the characters really work for it), and have them finding an assortment of clues that may not have a clear meaning at the time.\nOnly fill the reader in on details they would have no way to be privy to (like how Seph noted that the label on the crates belonged to a local store) and let them do the rest of the work. Basically, you’re giving your audience everything the characters have, and allowing them time to piece it all together alongside them.\nEventually, you’ll wanna have a moment where the characters themselves are allowed to recollect and put the whole thing into perspective, making theories and whatnot. This will catch up the readers that are just in it for the story alone, and not the brain teasers. That way they’re not left behind by a plot that’s overly ambiguous. These approaches can be used simultaneously relatively easily, and will allow both types of readers to better enjoy the detective side of your plot. I know you certainly have the capability to pull it off.\nHonestly, I really enjoyed Dogs and Sailors. I recommend it as is… and this is where we get into the reboot. I realize some of my recommendations may not be possible in the current first issue, even with the heavy modification I’m told is planned. But I do hope they can help you in the future. Don’t remove things if you have a good idea, plots like this benefit from being complicated. Making this story simple, shouldn’t be your goal. Think about how your antagonists operate exactly, and how they’d react to a situation you plan to put them in. Make them competent and threatening, if they’re meant to be. Don’t shy away from putting your leads through a grinder to get to them.\nForester informed me they were so deathly afraid of making Seph (the main character) a Gary Stu, they opted to make him borderline incopetent. Obviously they realize that was a mistake if it was said to me, but I think I may still have something to add: You never see an interesting character being called a Gary Stu. Contrary to popular belief, a powerful character does not make a poor one. It’s why. What makes them so good at what they do, how hard did they have to work for it? If they’re naturally adept, display that. Don’t just make them do things inexplicably. A character doesn’t need to be relatable to be a good one, they need to be intriguing.\nWhat’s their thought process, what makes them the way they are? Get inside their head, especially in a story like this. Show us how things affect them, and what made them the way that they are. No one calls Batman a Gary Stu because he’s the “world’s greatest detective”. They find him intriguing because of the broken mental state that turned him into that. I find Seph’s story arc intriguing. An idealist, and a talented detective made more harsh and cynical by the horrible world he inhabits. That’s good shit, don’t ditch it.\nIf this is what Forester thinks is bad, I can’t wait to see what they think is worth a re-release. Dogs and Sailors may not be perfect, but it’s above average. Quite a bit of potential here. I found myself genuinely enjoying the story, and wanting to see what happened next. I’d say this original version is worth your money, so the fact that there’s a revitalization on the way should excite you as much as it does me.\nKeep a close eye on this one.\n","date":"2021-02-20","id":3,"permalink":"/blog/dogs-and-sailors/","summary":"(DISCLAIMER: This is an archived article from my time at the gaming/pop-culture website “Escape Zero”.

All articles with this disclaimer were written in the latter third of 2019.)\nYou know, my love for noir stories and my habit of writing characters with seriously fucked up lives might lead some people to believe Changeling wouldn’t be up my alley, but it is. I like wholesome stuff sometimes. Slice of life can be a nice to consume, almost calming. Stories like this give me that specific feeling of a youthful nostalgia. Just don’t let me anywhere near the genre, or the main character will end up with a horribly abused sister and will be forced to kill someone before she’s even eighteen. That’s not a joke, it actually happened. I shouldn’t be allowed to touch typically cathartic genres.\nDISCLAIMER: While I have zero intention of allowing this to affect my critique, for the sake of ethical transparency I feel the need to inform everyone reading of something about myself. A friend of mine works on this comic series. Though, not on the particular comic I’m reviewing here. With that out of the way, let’s get started.\nOverall, I actually enjoyed Changeling. In the between damn near perfect Adobe Kroger, and the unfortunately lengthed review I had to write about Mythics, Changeling is more of a mixed bag. I liked it, but there are a noticeable few things that could be improved. I think these kats have potential. It’s definitely way better than… some other recent indie comics I’ve seen, related to a certain movie franchise.\nThe writing isn’t bad. It can be a little clunky, the same words used in the very same sentences a bit too much, things like that. At first I thought Brett (the writer) just might be trying to write as the character who was doing the talking, but then another character who seems to be intended to have more proper speech did the same later. So I’m not certain which it is. Things were set up well, other things were teased well. That’s all you really need to get people invested. The religious angle is interesting, a characteristic all the stories in the Mythoverse seem to share.\nThere’s nothing all that substantial to say about the writing either way. That’s better than it being bad, mind you. Far better. There was just enough here to latch on to, and nothing that stopped me from doing so. You can always get better at something, you’re on the right track.\nThere were some minor punctuation issues. One seemed to be a genuine mistake. “Cause” (short for because) is meant to have an apostrophe in front of it. This was only missing in one place, so I’m assuming they already know and just missed that one in editing. However, there were other things. For example: When a character goes to explain something, a comma is used to begin what should be another sentence separated with a colon (:). Kinda like how I started my own explanation just now.\nI wish I could point you to a specific place to brush up on this sort of thing, but unfortunately I don’t really remember where I picked up a lot of this myself. School didn’t help me with my writing at all after third grade. I just kinda take things from all over the place whenever I have an opportunity. All I can really do is recommend you do the same. Pick apart other people’s writing, good and bad. Identify what works, what doesn’t, and exactly why. You learn a lot of tricks and subtleties that way. You’ll find what makes certain types of stories succeed, and why others like them fail. Read and watch reviews, look up videos about storytelling on Youtube. These things helped me a lot. I learned to identify everything about a story, and how to more effectively write my own.\nOne really small thing that kinda sits between art and writing. The same text boxes are used for the main character's thoughts as the comic’s narration. It never gets confusing, but it certainly has the potential to. I’d recommend maybe making those use different colors before it becomes one.\nAnother related thing is the use of different fonts. It’s actually the only reason I had a clue that a certain character was meant to be speaking differently, since the writing wasn’t necessarily communicating that. It’s a good idea.\nUp next: The art. It’s decent, and I mean that as more of a compliment than it sounds. Victor (the artist) is clearly inexperienced, but I think he’s got a lot of potential. The simple style works well for the type of story this is. This one’s got a bit of that “same-face” problem going on too, but it benefits from the designs being wildly different in other ways. Just eyeballing it, I think a lot of these characters probably have distinct silhouettes. I also have a couple of suggestions that may help. I covered some things in the “Mythics” review, and since I know the creators are reading these now, I won’t annoy Victor by repeating myself. That being said, his style is much more simple than what’s in Mythics, so not all of those suggestions may work for him.\nI’m guessing Victor previously worked on webcomics, and that maybe he worked on a lot of furry art? I can’t help but notice he has a hard time drawing full human bodies. It’s a common web comic tactic to keep scenes and shots simple, only showing the upper half of characters.\nBut when a non-human guy comes into the story, he’s the best looking thing in the whole comic.\nThis guy looks fantastic. He’s got a lot of detail, even seems to have a texture. If you can give the humans this kind of love, it’ll go a long way.\nI have one recommendation, and it’s not gonna be easy: Challenge yourself with everything you draw. Make sure there’s something new in everything, even if it’s small. And don’t call it finished until you get everything as right as you can get it. It’ll make you wanna quit sometimes, but it’s the only reason I’ve made so much progress with my own art as quickly as I have. Draw more full bodies, don’t stop until it looks how you think it should. I understand that’s probably not feasible while working on the comic itself, so you’re probably gonna have to do a lot of practice sketches on the side of you intend to take this advice.\nOne more art suggestion. As it turns out, the eye technique we both use isn’t actually all that different, yours is just much more exaggerated, where as mine leans far more towards realism.. So I can actually show you a technique I use that might help you vary your faces a bit more despite the simplistic style.\nI couldn’t help but notice you used almost the exact same style of “eyelash” on all of your female characters. Only one of them seemed to have a slightly different eye shape.\nTry experimenting with the sort of shapes and whisps you can make. You might be surprised with the amount of variety you can come up with. I sketched out these two as an example, and neither of these can be seen on any character I’ve ever drawn. When you come up with one you like, ensure it always remains unique to whatever character you give it to.\nWith this specific feature being so abstract, it’s very noticeable the same style is used for every character. Play around with it, see what you come up with.\nOne thing I’d like to compliment Changeling on, is that the action has more than one panel. Not to dog on Mythics, but going from that to this was night and day. Even though the action in this was a tad stilted, I could at least tell what was going on. It makes a pretty big difference.\nSomething interesting I noticed (that you may have noticed the the few pictures I used), is that the space outside the panels is actually colored to suit the scene. Sometimes, it’ll even fade into another color mid page to fit what’s happening. Surrounding what the reader is seeing in what’s basically mood lighting is… actually kinda clever. I don’t think I’ve ever seen that before.\nI’m gonna stop myself before I write another article that’s far too long. Hopefully I’ve made my thoughts clear. I look forward to seeing what these guys come up with, and watching them improve. Actual effort was put into this, and it shows even if the skill of the creators isn’t quite where they want it to be. They made a complete product, and delivered it on time. Despite what’s holding them back, they made sure something of substance was here to be had.\nSo yeah, it’s not this huge, amazing action story with superb professional art like you might be looking for. It’s not gonna blow you away. But it is good. It was a nice little note for me to end on with Mythoverse, almost innocent (if it weren’t for some of the darker scenes). I’d like to see what happens next, it managed to make me care about the character.\nIf you’re willing to go for something that’s maybe not quite the most top tier thing you’ve ever seen, or looking for something just a little more pure and honest: This is a good way to go. I recommend Changeling.\n","date":"2021-02-20","id":4,"permalink":"/blog/changeling/","summary":"(DISCLAIMER: This is an archived article from my time at the gaming/pop-culture website “Escape Zero”.

As such, this article is old, and it’s date and timestamp here are not representative. All articles with this disclaimer were written in the latter third of 2019.)\nI’d like to make something clear before we really get into this: I’m going to be very harsh, I have a lot of criticisms for this one. I can only stress that it not be taken as an attack, rather advice. I hear the creators of this one have been very open to critique, and are heeding it. That’s good, and they should be commended for that. So I just want them to be aware if they’re reading this, that every harsh thing I have to say is in an effort to help them improve the project they’re clearly passionate about.\nDISCLAIMER: While I have zero intention of allowing this to affect my critique, for the sake of ethical transparency I feel the need to inform everyone reading of something about myself. A friend of mine works on this comic series. Though, not on the particular comic I’m reviewing here. With that out of the way, let’s get started.\nMythics is my least favorite of the first three “Mythoverse” comics. It’s not all bad… I just really didn’t enjoy it, and there are quite a few reasons why. At the risk of upsetting my boss with an absurdly lengthed article, I’m going to go into detail about exactly why I feel the way that I do, in the hopes that I can more thoroughly advise the creators. Let’s start with the good.\nLike I mentioned with Adobe Kroger, I very much tire of the bland, same-looking art that plagues the comic industry today. So I’m happy to see that Mythics very much as a style of it’s own. The linework is soft, the style is expressive, and the use of color is a pleasure to look at. It does a great job of evoking the fantasy that the story revolves around. It’s not heavily detailed, but it doesn’t need to be. As much as it pains me to say it (and likely pains the creators more to hear it)… that’s where my ability to compliment Mythics ends.\nI’ll start with the shorter criticism: The story isn’t very good. Not that the idea is bad, it’s just that the execution is ameteaur. Sloppy frankly, in some places. Yeah, this is why I gave that warning at the start. The problems start in the very first panel. Who’s narrating? At first I thought it was our main gal, but another box at the bottom of the same page suggests it’s the guy next to her. So that’s it then, right? No, because another box of the same color and font of the first two on the third page uses the same nickname for the antagonists that the main gal does later in the story. So who in the world is talking?\nThe solution to this problem is simple: Assign a color to each character. I’m reminded of a Spider-Man comic I have. Spider-Man’s thoughts are in blue boxes with black text. Black Cat’s thoughts are in black boxes with white text. You don’t need to overtly establish which character these boxes belong to, the dialogue can often do that. However, there is another step you can take. The same comic I just cited, introduces this concept by having only that character (sometimes among clearly unimportant background characters) in view for the first few panels that the narration boxes are introduced. So when the blue box goes on for a few panels with only Peter Parker clearly in the scenes, it’s obvious those boxes belong to him. The same technique is used when Black Cat is introduced into the story.\nSo what about the possibility that all of these are the same character? Then you’ve got a dialogue problem. Try saying something that would easily distinguish the character right away. The establishment trick from the last paragraph would’ve also helped. Adobe Kroger used both of these things to make it clear who was talking. As well, different characters should have different speech patterns, and distinct personalities. They should use different words, and have different mannerisms. Structure their sentences differently, give them a unique way of responding to things.\nI simply can’t comprehend a portion of your presentation, that’s a huge problem whatever the cause is.\nNow, I should say this since it’s come up: I’ll be comparing this to Adobe Kroger a lot. Not only because I feel the writing is better in that, but also because the creators will have a known comparison, and can possibly get help in these aspects from their fellow creators if they want.\nYou might also be wondering why I haven’t referred to the main gal by her name yet. I don’t know it. In one place she’s called “Elthia”, in another she’s called “Maria”. I have no clue what this character’s name is, or why she’s called by two different names in the exact same first issue. There’s a point where being vague, becomes withholding information.\nThat segways surprisingly well. So there’s no better way to express the rest of my problems, without just laying it all out in one go (at least to start). Why did only one witch try to fight back against main girl? Why doesn’t she have any kind of martial training if magic can be just turned off? Why did she try to fight if she knew she couldn’t defend herself? Why didn’t any of the other five witches there try to help against the two people that were a threat (martial prowess goes a long way, but so do numbers)? How are these people any kind of threat? Why haven’t they been crushed yet? Why did the main two just let all of the witches go after they murdered a family and attempted to sacrifice the baby? How does sending a bunch of incopetent underlings to botch a job that alerts two seperate opposing organizations to your movements serve a greater plan (not to mention the horrible death knell of a cliche that scene was)? And that’s the whole first issue right there.\nYou don’t have to explain everything, but you do need to lay the foundation. I understand what’s happening in Adobe Kroger, even if I don’t know everything. With Adobe Kroger, I’m intrigued by the details. In Mythics, I’m lost as to what’s even happening. It’s a difference of: “Huh, I wonder what non-human guy was.” and, “Why is everyone in this story a hapless moron?” The main character wins because the antagonists are hopelessly incompetent. The antagonists get off scot-free because the main characters let them go for reasons that aren’t so much as mentioned, so I’m just left to assume they’re incompetent too.\nThese are all easily solved problems, is the thing. For example: Maybe make the characters seem defensive of the child as the witches are allowed to escape. Or if there’s an outside force stopping them, have someone make a comment along the lines of, “I can’t believe they’re making us do this.” A simple nod or mention is all that’s needed to justify something to the audience. Make all the witches attack instead of just one, or none at all. Either would make them seem more rational than what’s here. The former would have the benefit of better displaying the skill of our main character, assuming she fought them off.\nInstead of being treated to a story, I was utterly confused as to what was happening in front of me. These questions of mine didn’t require any critical thinking, these are the first things that came into my mind upon reading it. Total lack of understanding. All I know (aside from what was in the introduction) is that alternate dimensions exist, and some witches tried to sacrifice a baby to a demon lord.\nHere’s what I learned about Adobe Kroger’s plot over the course of the first issue: The Order of the Carolingian Cross is out to stop demonic worshippers from indoctrinating a group of girls. Magic works through both the user’s conviction, and incantation. Non humans are not only on earth, but in the antagonist organization. The antagonists are competent enough to have magical barriers, and a fast responding security force. They are also very near to achieving their goal at the time the story starts. Adobe herself has a neurological disability holding her back, but her skill and determination get her through regardless. She’s also so dedicated to her role as protector, that she flung herself in front of a bystander despite not really knowing if she’d be able to protect herself from the same fate. I have questions, but I was never once confused.\nVagueness inspires investigation, and critical thought. It implies information. Withholding information only confounds the reader, and makes them wonder why they’re even bothering to read your story if you’re going to refuse to tell them anything about it.\nNow we’re on to art. While the art was certainly my favorite part of Mythics, there are a couple serious problems with it. Now I’m gonna be going in depth here, I have some legitimate advice for the artist to couple with my critiques. To do this, I’ll actually be using my own art as examples alongside theirs. It’s not because I think I’m some amazing artist. Think of it as me “putting my money where my mouth is”. I’m about to pick apart someone’s art in great detail, so I’m going to put my own on the line as well.\nSimplest first. What is she using as a weapon? Are those tonfas? I can barely see them, and I can’t tell what they are. That’s just my best guess. When you’re using a lot of heavy blacks like that, you’ve got to let a smidge of light touch the edges, that way you can differentiate what everything is. Where the object ends, and where the background begins. It also helps to distinguish bends and curves. But these things are just jet black, and I can’t make them out. Another thing you can do, is avoid coloring with total blacks. Both techniques can be seen here (but I get it, harsh blacks are really cool looking, I don’t think I’ll go this particular route again myself).\nIt’s not like you have to outline the whole thing with light, just enough to imply the shape is enough. Human minds are good at extrapolating patterns, you’ve just gotta give people a hint.\nAnother smaller complaint, is the main gal’s design. It looks like she just got done jogging. It’s not even just a matter of personal preference, it’s about as impractical as a swimsuit. One of the few things the story does make clear, is that there are other worlds. That, and the fact that they’re specifically in this park to find the witches and stop them. So why would she dress this way? What if she’s taken into an environment where that kind of clothing could get her killed? The guy she’s with is dressed in a far more universally useful outfit. It’s not like I think everything has to be practical in a fantasy. But it’s not good from a character design standpoint either. It’s just a basic tank top and shorts, absolutely nothing else.\nAllow me to better explain why that latter portion is an issue. Let’s say there were no other problems with character design at all in this, just the outfits. Take any other female character from this story, and put her in the same basic clothing. Now turn them both into silhouettes. What’s the difference? Now you might be thinking, “Well of course there isn’t one, not when you set up that extremely specific scenario.” And to that I say: You missed the point. These characters are not real. You do not have to put them in extremely bland, lifelike clothing that literally any of them might decide to put on one day. Literally any woman that happened to be jogging through the part that night, might be wearing that exact outfit.\nHer companion (Galatyn I think is his name) has the same problem, but at least his outfit has the excuse of practicality. So if it’s not practical, and it’s not a good design, why did you put your character in this? It’s not like she’s just sitting at home, or out jogging for real and runs into this by accident. She is looking for witches that are attempting to summon a demon, and she chose to dress like she’s going to the gym.\nI should elaborate on the silhouette thing more. You can have two characters in similar outfits that are still distinct from each other at a glance. The reason this matters, is easy identification of characters. This is issue one, we’re not familiar with these people yet. So if we’re given nothing to easily spot them with, the process is only going to be more difficult. The hairstyle the character has, accessories, the way they wear the clothing, how they carry themselves. Do these characters even have distinct body types? These are all small things you can do that won’t break any realism you might be going for.\nHere’s a good example. It’s from an article I worked on recently where I was complimenting the media on its character design.\nNow this series is a bit more abstract with its design, but this is a relevant example of two characters who dress in a very similar manner, whose silhouettes look completely different at a glance. Even with similar body types these two characters are distinct from each other, because every other factor was made unique to them. It’s not about whether or not you can tell the silhouettes of your characters apart from each other. It’s whether or not your brand new audience can. Even if you have no idea what these example characters are from, you can easily tell they’re different characters.\nThis is another thing Adobe Kroger did well. It’s not like I expect your characters to stand out against an international network’s worth of characters, that’s impossible. I just expect the characters in your story to stand out against each other. Adobe looks like a Matrix reject, but at least I can tell her apart from the other characters in her own story. There’s a reason you open with the iconic outfit (any time during the opening story), and not the casual one.\nOne more smaller issue before we move on to the most complicated one. Your panels can be hard to read, and the action is even more incomprehensible. You’re allowed to have more than panel for your action. Trust me, I know it’s a pain to spend so much time drawing out complete motion. But it pays off, your audience suffers otherwise. I can’t tell what main gal is supposed to be doing when she fights the witch, and that’s saying something as a martial artist that should at least be able to extrapolate things like that. Do you not know anything about martial arts, is that why you didn’t want to spend so much time drawing your character using it? If so, don’t you think it would be prudent to at least look into techniques relevant to what your character is doing? Trust me, people like me appreciate effort if nothing else. It’s nice to see artists/writers/actors that at least attempt to know what they’re doing.\nIt’s not just a matter of reading the action either. The witch moves and main gal takes her out in a single panel. It adds credence to the “non-threat” question I brought up earlier. If our main character has to at least be seen doing something extremely competent to take down a foe (even if she pulls this particular thing off flawlessly), we as the audience can see where the danger might lie. People often accuse characters of being a Mary Sue citing a displayed ability to fight competently as a reason, just because no training or practice was hinted at beforehand. This frankly just isn’t true. If a character is shown immediately to be a skilled fighter, that is your establishment that they’re a skilled fighter. The rest can be touched on later. However, we as the audience were given no reason here to believe that main gal is competent, just that the witch was extremely incompetent.\nAlmost forgot, one more thing: The robes of the witches suddenly change in the middle of the scene. At first they’re open almost all the way down to the groin, but then they suddenly close to a pretty safe for work extent. I’m indifferent either way. I’m not gonna complain that you’re sexualizing your characters too much, or not enough. I just want you to pick one for the remainder of a scene.\nPeople often throw around the term “same-face”, too much sometimes. Other times, people are all too eager to try and refute those claims based on a single minor detail or two, which doesn’t matter in the slightest to anyone new to the story. In other words: They’re missing the point. “Same-face” doesn’t mean that there are no singular differences at all, it means there are so few it practically doesn’t matter. And any artist that refuses to accept this criticism, is only harming their own work.\nThere are eight billion people in the world. And of those people, often less than ten are genuine look-alikes. Human beings are so wildly diverse that if the characters in your story look even mostly the same, new readers will be easily confused. Now I know this is a simpler style, but there’s still a lot you can do. I don’t expect you to make every random background character diverse, but if your actual characters are it won’t matter. I’m going to go over some suggestions, examples, and the critiques of what’s causing the problem in great detail here. So if the artist happens to be reading this: Brace yourself, I know how it feels.\nFirst, I’m gonna share where this was personally a problem.\nRight there. I know now, and upon a second look through of course that the small panel on the right is actually Galatyn, but I initially confused it for the main witch. The only obvious differences being that he has a somewhat wider chin, pronounced cheekbone, and the fact that he’s not wearing a hood. But his hairstyle is similar, his face is similar, even his eyes and eyebrows. In such a small panel that only focuses on his face, it was very easy to miss upon first viewing. Like I said I don’t expect your characters to stand out against every other character in the world, but if I’m having trouble telling them apart from panel to panel you have a serious character design problem.\nThis is a symptom of a larger issue. Almost all the characters have nearly the exact same facial structure. Even between men and women, they’re strikingly similar. The only character I found to be truly distinctive, was this guy:\nHe has a lot of notable features and details. His eyebrows are different from everyone’s (most usually have the same two types), even his head shape is different from the norm. Most male characters have the same shape as Galatyn, the other character in this scene even has the exact same nose.\nAlright, now that I’ve covered what the problem is and the negative toll it can take, I’m gonna get into the nitty gritty of where exactly it’s present and how you could fix it. I won’t be displaying every panel that has these problems. If I did, this article could frankly be considered piracy. So I’m just gonna grab one or two instances these issues are most prevalent, and hope you take my word for it that they exist elsewhere.\nNOTE: I have no idea why there was so much image quality loss when I extracted these pictures. The pixilation is not the fault of the creators.\nNow I know what some people are gonna say right off the bat, because they’ve never actually tried drawing original characters before, or so much as thought about what they intend to say. Go hand draw some V’s real quick, tell me how many of them are exactly the same.\nThe point here is just how similar each of these characters jaws are structured. I drew one “V” with a line tool on the far left witch, then I copied and rotated the same one to fit the others (that’s why there’s some quality loss on them). I didn’t alter them any other way. That’s four characters in the same panel with the exact (for all intents and purposes we already covered this) same jawline. These lines very slightly failing to match up every time is not an indicator of an effort being made to distinguish them, it simply means the artist is human and can’t draw the precise same “V” shape every single time. These jaws shouldn’t be anywhere near this close to each other.\nYou can see I didn’t bother with the one in the back. I can tell just by looking at her that she’s the only one with a legitimately different shape.\nWe have characters in scenes with each other who have the exact same cheek and jaw line from the exact same angle as each other. Just imagine how many times this same shape is used at this angle throughout the first issue. It really is every female character. Male characters have the same issue, just with a different shape from the females. We’ve already talked about how there’s one exception to that.\nI know there’s a very slight difference between the placement of their cheekbones. But with how similar all of the faces are in this, I’m not confident in saying that it wasn’t by accident. Not to mention everything else.\nTo the artist’s credit, the eyes of characters are often quite varied. That helps. I think the noses are mostly different as well, but there’s so little detail on the noses of female characters it’s impossible to tell unless they’re at a profile angle. You might try adding a bit more, that shouldn’t break the style you’re going for. Remember what I said about the blacks and lighting: You don’t need a full outline, just enough to suggest the shape. Mouths just aren’t detailed at all, you might consider changing that too.\nIn an effort to give helpful suggestions, and in the interest of good faith: This is the part where I start picking apart my own art. Rather than the simple example I used one of my pieces for earlier, we’re gonna go into my exact method and reasoning in places I think will help Beth Varni (the artist) improve.\nWhen you’re working with a simplistic or unrealistic style, you have to boil down character features to very basic aspects. Is their jawline flat or round? Is their nose straight, or does it curve? Which way? Are their cheeks concave, convex or in the middle? How distinct are their cheekbones? How do their eyes tilt? What’s the shape and thickness of their eyebrows? What’s the size and shape of their mouth? How wide is their chin, or their face? What’s the length?\nThese are all distinct features that you can communicate in a cartoon or comic style. Going for realism simply means that they will be less exaggerated, and have more lifelike proportions. Imagine the character in your head at their most accurate to what you want them to be. Take note of what their basic characteristics are. Assign that specific combination of features to that character, and don’t give that exact combo to anyone else in the story. Mix them all around as much as you can for everyone, no two characters should have the exact same set. No one differing feature is enough, you need many.\nSome of the features of the characters above are similar, some are different that can’t be seen at the certain angle you see them in. But since so many features differ between them, we can focus in on the few that can be seen for all of them, and there are still distinct differences. One of them is at a profile angle, unlike the other two. However, you can still see that the eyebrows, eyes, nose shape and jawline are all different from at least one or the other. In both cases, more than one of those things is different.\nAll of a character’s features are important, you never know what angle you’ll be viewing them from. Don’t skimp out on any of them.\nI wanna go on, put the surgical light on my own art some more. I mean my stuff certainly isn’t perfect. But this article is long enough to put my boss into a grave just so that she can turn over in it. I think I’ve made my points and suggestions pretty clear. I know I’ve already said this at the start, but I’d like to bookend this thing by saying it again: The creators of Mythics have already been pretty open to criticism. I’ve been very brutal in this article, but that’s only because I see no point in dishonesty. My intention isn’t to kick Beth and Matt (the writer) while they’re down. My hope is that this in depth critique alongside suggestions for improvement will help them make their project better. I wish you the best.\nUnfortunately, I just can’t recommend this one. I hear talk of a re-release to fix the issues, and their willingness to accept the criticism levied at them is something I can only see as being a boon to the future of Mythics. But right now, I can’t in good faith tell anyone that they would enjoy this. I’d say wait and see what happens before you drop cash on this one.\nWe’ve got one more issue that launched the Mythoverse, I’ll see you in the next review.\n","date":"2021-02-20","id":5,"permalink":"/blog/mythics/","summary":"(DISCLAIMER: This is an archived article from my time at the gaming/pop-culture website “Escape Zero”.

All articles with this disclaimer were written in the latter third of 2019.)\nYou know, comics haven’t interested me in some time. Not the mainstream ones anyway. Whether it’s because I feel the writing and art are becoming bland, or because of reasons I don’t feel are appropriate to bring up here. It’s often lesser known comics, or creative spinoffs I find myself drawn to these days. I’ve recently begun breaking into manga, much the same way I started watching more anime some years back when I began running out of interesting things to watch from the west. So it’s nice to see a small startup like this come along, and inject some new life into the industry.\nDISCLAIMER: While I have zero intention of allowing this to affect my critique, for the sake of ethical transparency I feel the need to inform everyone reading of something about myself. A friend of mine works on this comic series. Though, not on the particular comic I’m reviewing here. With that out of the way, let’s get started.\nI honestly don’t have much to criticize when it comes to Adobe Kroger, I’m just gonna come out and say it. No nothing’s perfect obviously. But the few complaints I do have are extremely minor, and are more nitpicks than anything else. Like how I feel a small bit of the dialogue is a bit too modern for the time this supposedly takes place. Or how a certain extremely complex pose or scene looks just a little wonky. Like I said, nitpicks. This is pretty solid first issue. I just have one major complaint: It’s too short. The story screeches to a halt, just as I start really getting into it. And that’s a shame, because I was getting into it. I understand that helps sell comics, and I appreciate that these guys need to more than most. I’m just never going to like it.\nIf that sort of thing doesn’t bother you, or you’re at least willing to put up with it like I am, then I’ve got good news: This comic is great. I really like it actually. Looking at the cover, I was worried it was gonna be more of the same-looking art that plagues the mainstream comic industry. You know how comics will often have these intensely detailed, sometimes amazing covers, but then you open them up and it’s the same old crap with no unique style or presence at all? This one has the opposite problem.\nNow that’s not to say the cover art is bad, it’s not. I just have a personal distaste for this method that’s become the norm. As if the artists aren’t allowed to express themselves with a personal style, and are all taught to draw the exact same aesthetic. Adobe Kroger is a great example of what happens when an artist is allowed to stray from that formula even a little. The cover was actually drawn by the same artist, and colored by another. So it’s clear Mr. Panganiban is versed in that sort of approach. But when allowed to present things how he pleases, he chose this incredible inked style with heavy blacks and fantastic detail. It really evokes this sort of dark noir emotion that perfectly matches the content of the story.\nI mean, what can I say about the art other than that? The action panels make sense, and aren’t hard to read. The characters all look distinct from each other. Even extras (that aren’t wearing uniforms) can be differentiated from one another. It’s quality, and expressive. I have no complaints here.\nNow we’re on to the writing. Other than that seriously minor nitpick from earlier, I really like it. You’re introduced to the character, they’re motivations, their world, and the rules with brevity and grace. It has to rely on the opening monologue a little to get that done, but that honestly only fits with the noir setting. Not having the main character monologue in noir is like not having a sea monster in seafaring fiction. It’s not required, but it’s fun and distinctive.\nOur main gal is well characterized. You understand why she’s doing what she does, and how you should feel about her. Even though you have no way of knowing how much of it is true, you know that at the very least she believes every word of it. Speaking of which: The world controlling religious organization is the good guy in this story, or at least they’re presented like that. Yeah, that’s different. Part of me hopes it stays that way, it would certainly set the story apart.\nAnother thing Adobe Kroger does that I find unique, is the character’s weakness. She has a stutter. Let me explain: In just the first few panels, it’s established that the magic in this world (at least the magic the main character is using) requires incantations to use. The importance of this rule is rather well established with the subsequent reveal of Adobe’s speech impediment. It’s an interesting idea, one I don’t think I’ve ever seen before. Many magic systems use incantations, but none have used that as an obstacle for the protagonist far as I know.\nThat segways nicely. Not enough stories with magic systems make the rules clear. It often seems as if characters can just do whatever they damn well please when the plot demands it. Adobe Kroger manages to effectively establish that there are rules here, and what some of them actually are, all without literally explaining those things to a character (in other words: the audience). It’s a balance of subtlety and presentation that so many writers simply fail to understand. The fact that Mr. Sacharow (the writer) has that skill, bodes very well for the nuanced and complicated story this comic seems to tease.\nOverall, I give this a resounding recommendation. Despite my apprehension for the cliffhanger, I’m excited to see what this story and Mr. Sacharow have to offer. There’s a lot of potential here for some interesting development, and a unique setting. I’m looking forward to the next issue (and hoping it’s a bit longer). I really wanted to show your more of the art here, but I didn’t wanna risk putting too much out there. It’s a joy to look at.\nGive this one a buy, help these kats keep it up.\n","date":"2021-02-20","id":6,"permalink":"/blog/adobe-kroger-dame-commander/","summary":"(DISCLAIMER: This is an archived article from my time at the gaming/pop-culture website “Escape Zero”.

But I did not like Streets of Rage 3. I knew I didn’t the first time, or the second time I played it. I was reminded why when I picked it up one more time for this review. I don’t know how, but all the wires just crossed in the wrong places for me here. On top of the more subjective things like art, aspects of gameplay also seemed to regress here for some reason. It’s a damn shame, and likely why it’s taken twenty years for us to see a low budget sequel.\nNOTE: I’ve played these games using a few methods, even including a plug in Sega Genesis emulator (the kind that comes with a bunch of games on it, and also has a cartridge port). But my preferred way is the “Sega Vintage Collection: Streets of Rage”. It’s a clean port, and has a lot of extra features. It’s available on Xbox One (360 backwards compatibility). You can also find each individual game for ¢99 on Steam, though these are likely more direct ports.\nNOTE: I had a rule for this article: Play as far as I could with the lives and continues provided. No tricks.\nStreets of Rage 3\nWe’re started off in the middle of the story this time, I’m assuming where the last game left off. That’s a kick in the nuts, confusing the hell out of players for not finishing a game with limited continues and no passwords. This game is surprisingly cutscene heavy, and it seems like it’s taking it’s cheesy story really seriously all of the sudden. The last game had a sense of humor, and seemed pretty self aware about it’s setup. It had a Jojo reference in it for Christ’s sake, a female enemy named “L. Lisa”. This game plays out - oddly enough, like a dumb action movie franchise that’s been going on too long.\nLet’s address the screeching elephant in the room: The music is terrible. Not just because I don’t like the genre, but because I never feel it fits what’s happening on screen. I’m never getting motivated by it, I’m thinking, “What the fuck is that noise?” But what happened? Yuzo Koshiro is still the composer, so obviously that’s not the problem. Or more accurately: He’s not the only composer, the other composer is a random number generator. Literally, the sequences in these tracks were randomly generated. The man invented something called an “Automated Composing System”. Apparently this stuff was pretty innovative and ahead of its time, but I really don’t care if it sounds like ass. I appreciate that Mr. Koshiro was just trying something new, any artist should. But they also need to be able to accept when those experiments yield unfortunate results. It sounds random, not like the auto generated music of today. It’s downright abrasive at times. It doesn’t even sound like music to me, just noise.\nWell, are there any upsides to the game? Yes, there’s… a few. You can sprint now, but the developers really just used this as an excuse to add unnecessary stretches to the levels. You have a dodge roll, allowing you to quickly move in either vertical direction. That’s handy. You don’t drop weapons when you throw enemies, that’s a good change. Oh, and this game has jiggle physics. Yeah, there was a pixel artist at Sega who took the time to animate Blaze’s boobs bouncing. I guess that means current developers really have no excuse. Speaking of painstaking animation: There’s actually a lot of dynamic background details here. The first level has chains that will shake when you slam enemies to the ground. Unfortunately, that’s where the praise I can give this game ends.\nThis game is basically Streets of Rage 2, except everything is worse. Much of the pixel art is copied, but enemies now have randomly sized health bars for some reason. So now it’s impossible to tell what the threat level is at a glance. Punching works less. The best way I can describe it is: The cone of effectiveness in front of you has been reduced. So have fun attempting pinpoint accuracy on the 2.5D plane. Speaking of attacks, the special attack now has a recharging meter. This would’ve been listed in the positives, if it weren’t for the fact that you can still use your specials and damage yourself while it’s drained. So now you’ll miss thanks to the smaller cone, and start killing yourself out of frustration. Weapons have very limited durability again. Because if something isn’t broken, why not fix it? Did they think the unbreaking weapons made the last game too easy? It’s not like you got to hold them for very long.\nSpeaking of difficulty, they decided to overcompensate for the last game. Streets of Rage 3 is the hardest of the series, and not in any fun creative ways. Bullshit bosses, and a ridiculous number of enemies. Combined with your less useful attacks… You can imagine. There’s less breakable objects in the environment, which directly translates to less chances for health items. Doesn’t exactly help with the difficulty. I mean this game doesn’t even give you a break on the first level, the difficulty feels like you’re starting in the middle of the story. I used all of my continues on the first level, yes really. You can probably guess I didn’t make it through the second level. That’s how bad this is, I got my shit kicked in after marathoning the series.\nThe music isn’t the only thing that’s had the personality drained from it. Even the art has taken a hit. Don’t get me wrong, the new pixel art isn’t low quality, it’s just drab. It’s like the game wasn’t allowed to have any color. Bright vibrant colors like pink seem to have been desaturated, even Blaze’s outfit is grey instead of red.\nThe game is bad. I was extremely disappointed by it. They had a winning formula, and somehow they blew it. It’s a damn shame, because I truly do consider Streets of Rage 2 one of the best retro titles out there. It hurt to see a series climb so high, just to face plant onto the pavement. Don’t bother picking this one up if you’re buying them separately. I can’t even recommend it on difficulty because it’s the cheap annoying sort. There are far better titles out there than Streets of Rage 3 if you found the last game’s challenge to be lacking. It just isn’t fun for me. I suppose we can only hope the next game learns from two decades of critique. Maybe I’ll see you then. Until next time, just keep moving forward.\n","date":"2021-02-20","id":7,"permalink":"/blog/streets-of-rage-3/","summary":"(DISCLAIMER: This is an archived article from my time at the gaming/pop-culture website “Escape Zero”.

It doesn’t get better than this. After playing Streets of Rage for the first time on my shitty little emulator, I thought to myself: “Damn. If this is how good the first one is, I wonder what the second one is like?” Let me tell you kids, I was not disappointed. In my opinion, this is the definitive Streets of Rage title. If you’re short on cash, or whatever reason you can only pick up one title from this series, make sure it’s Streets of Rage 2. Today, we’re gonna talk about why.\nNOTE: I’ve played these games using a few methods, even including a plug in Sega Genesis emulator (the kind that comes with a bunch of games on it, and also has a cartridge port). But my preferred way is the “Sega Vintage Collection: Streets of Rage”. It’s a clean port, and has a lot of extra features. It’s available on Xbox One (360 backwards compatibility). You can also find each individual game for ¢99 on Steam, though these are likely more direct ports.\nNOTE: I had a rule for this article: Play as far as I could with the lives and continues provided. No tricks.\nStreets of Rage 2\nThis time, it’s fancier than a text crawl. This time, we get one of those old school cutscenes with flashy animations and graphics. The opening explains that somehow (it’s never explained to my knowledge) the big bad from last time came back to life, and he has your pal Adam (one of the playable characters from the first game). So now it’s up to Axel, Blaze, and their two new companions Max and Skate to kick some more dicks in. It’s Streets of Rage 2, let’s fucking do this.\nYou pick Blaze because you’re lonely, and you’re dropped right into the action. Somehow, some fucking way, it’s all better. The music is thumping, fists are cracking skulls, and the game looks fantastic. Oh man the music. I had a few tracks in this game that I thought I didn’t like. But when they got to playing for a moment, they were all amazing. “Fighting in the Street” (the first level music from the original game) will always be iconic, but the increase in quality here is undeniable. There isn’t a single track in this game I don’t like. “Go Straight” and “Under Logic” are my favorites. As you can imagine, the remixes and remakes for the music in this game can be downright stellar, give it a look. This is some of Yuzo Koshiro’s best work.\nThis game is a fantastic example of limitation breeding innovation. This is running on the same hardware as the last game, but the improvement is night and day. However, one of the biggest contributing factors to why this game looks as good as it does, is also the cause of my single biggest problem with it’s gameplay. There’s less space on the screen. Or more accurately, everything on the screen is bigger. On top of the higher amount of work put into detail in general, the sprites themselves are larger to allow the characters and objects to receive the same treatment. I both love and hate this decision. The sprite work in this is some of the best on the Genesis, and they didn’t waste the newfound pixel count. But if you’re used to the first Streets of Rage (or perhaps regardless), you’ll be feeling constricted. Often times you’ll find enemies attacking from places you can’t see, or losing them on the edges of the screen.\nRemember that weapon problem from the last game, the one where you got trapped picking them up? Still a problem, but not as big of one. It’s been alleviated by the fact that you now only drop your weapon upon being knocked down, or grabbing an enemy. In other words: You’re not standing over it after you drop it. However, this game still suffers from the “same button” issue when you’re trying to swing your weapon while standing over another. On the bright side, weapons don’t even break anymore. Or at least if they do, I’ve never seen it happen. Now they only break if you drop them too many times, not from use. On top of that, the knife is useful! Bottle was cut though. The knife has more range, and fast attacks. Still not as much reach as a pipe, bat or sword (did I mention the replaced the bottle with katanas), but more than your fists, which was an issue before. Oh yeah and you can’t fucking throw them by accident. In fact, I don’t think you can throw them at all.\nThere are a few new additions to combat. For example, you have a lot more moves for each character you can learn. However, the most notable change is to the special attacks. Instead of it being a consumable like it was in the first game that had a single effect, there are now two special attacks for each character that can be used as many times as you want. The main issue is: It consumes some of your health every time. As a result, you’re almost discouraged to ever use it. I appreciate what they were going for, but I might’ve actually preferred a consumable special attack.\nSpeaking of combat: There’s actually a versus mode in this game (and the next) called “Duel”. So on top of the fun main game with it’s co-op, Streets of Rage 2 also doubles as a sort of fighting game. That was a fantastic deal for the time, it’s basically two games for the price of one. The only other game I recall doing it was Ninja Turtles for the Super Nintendo.\nSomething I really like about the game, is that levels are actually far more varied in both design and layout. Multifaceted even. You’ll find yourself walking through the street, into a bar, and out into a back alley in the first level alone. I think the name of the first level’s music “Go Straight” was a jab at the previous game’s much more primitive level design. You really were just walking forward with almost no variation.\nOne last thing: The game was actually kind of easy, at least compared to the first game. Not too easy I don’t think, but I managed to get farther into this one than either of the others. I thought it was just the right amount of challenge. A fun cathartic opening, with engaging difficult latter stages. Some might find it too easy, but I think it’s a great balance. It lets you get sucked in. I did have some issues with a boss or two, namely the one that’s using a jetpack. He’s easily the most annoying. Imagine trying to judge how high up this guy is and aim your jump attacks at him on the 2.5D plane. It’s very frustrating. Thankfully, the game picks right back up afterwards.\nThis is one of my favorite games of all time. The fact that it’s so old with so few flaws is frankly impressive. The pixel art is some of the best of the generation, the music is fantastic. It’s so unapologetically chessy. It’s colorful and pleasing to look at, and fighting the enemies never really gets old. Combat just generally feels good. There are far, far worse ways to spend your money. This is a game that needs to be a part of anyone’s collection. This is as good as they get, folks.\n","date":"2021-02-20","id":8,"permalink":"/blog/streets-of-rage-2/","summary":"(DISCLAIMER: This is an archived article from my time at the gaming/pop-culture website “Escape Zero”.

All articles with this disclaimer were written in the latter third of 2019.)\nSo, I’d like to say something before we get started. I didn’t play Streets of Rage growing up, none of them. I didn’t play a single entry in the series until we were well into the current generation of consoles (Xbox One and PS4 if this is somehow being read years later). I didn’t even have access to a Sega Genesis growing up (we had the Super Nintendo), only in my late teens. So when I say that the Streets of Rage series is among my favorite retro titles of all time, know that I say it without even a hint of nostalgia creating a bias. They are just good games, even all this time later.\nNOTE: I’ve played these games using a few methods, even including a plug in Sega Genesis emulator (the kind that comes with a bunch of games on it, and also has a cartridge port).

You can also find each individual game for ¢99 on Steam, though these are likely more direct ports.\nNOTE: I had a rule for this article: Play as far as I could with the lives and continues provided. No tricks.\nStreets of Rage\nOh man, where do I begin? The cheesy 80’s action movie setup maybe? You start out with a text crawl that basically tells you that the city is corrupt. Crime and violence plagues the streets, and even the cops are on the take. It then goes on to explain that our three main characters are either rogue cops or fighters that have taken it upon themselves to walk around and kick the shit out of anything that so much as looks like a gangster. Simple, effective, and it got me excited.\nYou pick a character, and you’re dropped in. The music tells you exactly what kind of schlocky romp this is gonna be. It’s some of the best of the 16-bit era, only outdone by its own sequel. That being said, I do have one major issue with the soundtrack: It’s the same music for every boss. Not a single one is different, at least none of the bosses I fought. There aren’t a whole lot of tracks in this game I don’t enjoy, and they make for an amazing companion when you’re fighting in the streets.\nEach stage ends with a boss, and they all have their own moves, patterns and weaknesses. Honestly though? Some are much better than others. For example, the second boss is actually designed to punish you for using the technique that was most useful against the first, and that’s great! But there are some that are either impossible to read, or impossible to dodge. It feels like the game is trying to eat your quarters. Which is really strange, since it never had an arcade release. Sometimes it’ll achieve the same effect by throwing numerous of some of the most annoying enemy types at you. There was one time that it not only did that, but an established enemy type started doing something new that made them invulnerable, only to come out of it and get a cheap shot within milliseconds. Moments like this are what drag the title down the most. I was finally taken down by two recolors of the character Blaze, probably the worst excuse for a boss in the game. Two fully realized movesets jumping around the screen and beating the crap out of you.\nCombat is satisfying and fun to this day. Your punches can knock down crowds of enemies if you manage to line them up right. Each character has a different move set, and little moves you can learn. Co-op can get pretty hectic, as your attacks can harm your teammate. Interestingly enough though, this also means you can use the same “traversal” moves on each other that you can use on enemies. As fun as it is though, the general combat isn’t free of issues. The biggest one I can think of is weapons. First off, the pipes and bats are easily the best ones, making bottles and knives nearly useless. The have more reach, they’re more durable, and they do the most damage. What’s worse, is that you can throw the knives. Sounds handy, until you realize the method of doing so is unclear at best. You’ll often find yourself throwing the knife when you’re simply trying to attack. Not to mention aiming the thing on a 2.5D plane. The bottles don’t suffer from this problem, and they even have a nice shattering effect as you use it and the durability goes down. However, they still lack the range and damage.\nAnother large issue, is also surrounding weapons. Now’s a good time to mention that the button you use to attack, is the same one you use to pick up items. Whenever you get hit, you drop your weapon. So you can get locked in a loop of trying to defend yourself, but instead picking up the weapon you just dropped and getting hit again. This will continue until the weapon breaks. The same rule applies to enemies you hit. So just imagine what can happen when there’s a bunch of weapons lying around you. Or worse, right next to you.\nThe sequels also share the problem of having the same button for everything. Granted, they found clever ways of alleviating it. I’m just baffled, why did they do this on a console with six face buttons? This was a Genesis exclusive.\nLet’s end this on a good note. The art direction and atmosphere is great. The even tried some ambitious things for the 16-bit era. There’s a level with an animated reflection of the city on the water in the background. There’s another on the beach where the waves are crashing against the shore, and water rains down on you. Many of the levels are lit up with colorful neon, others have a pallet and aesthetic all their own. Not a single one (that I saw) doesn’t give you some view of the city and lights. The backgrounds are filled with animated details.\nIt barely gets better than this folks, and we’re getting to that next.\n","date":"2021-02-20","id":9,"permalink":"/blog/streets-of-rage/","summary":"(DISCLAIMER: This is an archived article from my time at the gaming/pop-culture website “Escape Zero”.

As such, this article is old, and it's date and timestamp here are not representative. All articles with this disclaimer were written in the latter third of 2019.)\nIntroduction\nI’d like to say from the outset: It’s been about a decade since I’ve played any Call of Duty game. The last ones I touched were Modern Warfare 2, and Black Ops. I actually have quite a few fond memories with those games, but don’t expect me to be able to compare our current topic of discussion to every single yearly release since then. But that begs the question: What brought me back to the series? Nostalgia for the classic Modern Warfare games? If that were the case, I would’ve played Modern Warfare 3. Maybe it’s the fact that Microsoft can’t figure out how digital purchases work, and I got access to some unlucky sod’s pre-order edition? No, it was these two things: An apparent focus on more tactical gameplay, and the pathetic press catastrophe surrounding it. The latter however, is a topic for another article.\nI like more realistic, involved experiences when I play a military shooter of any kind. Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, SOCOM, Spec Ops, these are the modern military games I grew up with. Games that reward forethought, strategy, and caution. The run and gun gameplay that the Call of Duty series devolved into was of no interest to me. As you can imagine, I have a hard time filling that gap in my taste these days. “Ghost Recon: Breakpoint” can actually be quite good (mechanically), but that’s one of the few games out there right now. Thanks to executive decisions made with the title, it’s almost as if Ubisoft doesn’t want to allow it to succeed. On top of that, the game’s story completely fails to act upon it’s compelling setup and themes. So then we’re left with “Rainbow Six: Siege”. Despite my soft spot for the game and it’s realism oriented gameplay that rewards coordination and careful movement, I can’t deny it’s held back by an excessively grindy progression and an online only live service focus.\nSo then I started to hear about this new Call of Duty, a same titled reboot I would normally ignore the release of. An interesting, shocking story you say? People dying over and over when they fail to check their corners who then complain that the maps need fixing? Now you have my attention.\nThe Campaign\nNOTE: I played the campaign on the “Hardened” difficulty, which sits right above “Regular”, since I was after that more realistic experience. This made the gameplay’s strengths and weaknesses very clear. We’ll be covering them both.\nThis is a prequel story. They won’t tell you that, for some reason. The only thing that clued me in were references to the story of previous games beginning… Which were only relayed at the very end of this one. They could’ve come up with something else to call it, but I suppose that at least makes the redundant title somewhat understandable.\nHow is it though, the story? Well, I actually like it. It’s no shocking taboo that’s going to turn the tide of gaming as we know it, but it’s a well rounded story with likable characters and exciting escalating events. It’s the kind of political action plot you’d expect from the old school Tom Clancy games. Don’t take my comment about this not being a game changer the wrong way, this campaign does do some very surprising things. Things that do well to prove a lot of journalists aren’t really playing the game, if white phosphorus killstreaks are all they’re complaining about.\nI could talk about the crowds of civilians during terrorist attacks, or the supposed victims who surprise you by pulling a gun (and those are nice touches). But frankly, everyone has. Something I’d like to talk about, is the interesting way the game puts you on the other side of situations most games would put you in some sort of control of. How many times have you been a guerrilla fighter approaching your enemy under the cover of darkness, taking cover when exposed only by the light? How many times have you had to torture someone for information? How many times have you been there to save children and innocents from danger? How many games have put you in the helpless position of all these situations? Modern Warfare has a way of putting you in places most games don’t. You’re not usually the one holding a gun on someone’s family, because the good guys aren’t supposed to do stuff like that. This game puts you there, and even manages to give the characters a thoroughly understandable reason to do so.\nIt’s moments like this where the campaign shines. A huge enemy force is approaching your position under the cover of night, and your only reprieve is a flare launcher with limited ammo to give you a few moments of a fair fight. Or maybe you’re in a residential area with no idea who’s a threat and who’s not. Moments like these are every bit as teeth gritting as you would want them to be. There are even moments of social stealth where you have to blend in with a civilian environment and find a way to complete your objectives. They don’t hold up to the missions of old from Medal of Honor that had you playing the part of a World War II spy with a large (for the time) environment to explore, but the effort is appreciated.\nEven the more linear scripted events the series has faced harsh criticism for, offer you a pretty fair degree of freedom in this title. You might start out being led to the hope of safety by the father of your character in a flashback, but you’re quickly thrust into a stealth situation where you (playing as a helpless little girl I might add) have to defend yourself from a soldier using various tools in the environment. Even when you’re being tied up and tortured, you have the ability to influence events with your performance and dialogue choices. It’s clear the developers went to a lot of effort to tell the story they wanted, while still allowing there to be a game in those heavily guided scenarios.\nNow that we’re on the topic of linearity, why not start discussing level design? There’s actually a healthy mix here. You’ll have your “guided tour” sort of mission that leads you down a fairly straightforward path. Although, even those give you some fair sized arenas to play around in. However, there are also missions that open up and give you a large environment to sneak around and complete multiple objectives. The one where Captain Price covers you with a sniper rifle while you infiltrate a small township to search for a hostage was one of my favorites.\nThe weapons in this are great. Not as many as you’d expect from a game today, but I wasn’t disappointed by a single one of them. They sound fantastic, and they hit hard. They all perform realistically. Shotguns don’t magically stop being lethal because the enemy is more than four feet away from you, and they knock the guy off his feet when he isn’t. Assault rifles are reliable, high caliber sniper rifles sever limbs. You can throw a grenade into a room, and no one walks out of it.\nSpeaking of believable lethality: This is the only Call of Duty game I recall feeling the need to crawl along the ground just to avoid being picked off. Sure you can sometimes survive a shot, thanks to the typical regeneration. But the sense of danger here is very real, and you don’t wanna risk it.\nSomething I’d like to commend this game for, is that there are actually a good few instances where you aren’t penalized for shooting civilians for friendlies. It’s usually in the more crisis oriented missions where they’ll cut you slack, only failing you in missions where you’re working with a specific squad that you (ideally, we’ll get to this) should have no reason to be shooting. This is a game where you can take out a group of civilians by accident, and you just have to live with it.\nAnother thing I appreciate about the campaign, is that “gimmick” features don’t just up and disappear after they’re introduced like you’d expect. Night vision, disarming tripwire, marking targets for support fire… All of these things are used again throughout the missions. Only one feature is introduced never to be seen again: An instance where you’re able to control explosive rigged RC planes that the rebel fighters set up. It was about as exciting as it sounds, probably why it was only used once. Well that, and long range sniping mechanics. But that’s just not necessary at the range most missions have you fighting in.\nEnemy AI is pretty solid for the most part, and the time to kill is extremely fast for you and your foes. This makes every gunfight very intense. If you’re not paying attention to your surroundings for even a moment, you will die. It’s not often a game conveys the very real danger of a bullet like this one does. Regenerating health is honestly one of the few things keeping this from being more of a simulator experience like Siege. This topic however, is a great segway.\nYou’re wondering at this point, “Well, what’s the bad news? It can’t be perfect.” And of course, you’re right. However, I’d like to stress that the real issues are actually very few. But holy ghillie relieving Christ are some of them glaring. I’ll do my best to order this in a way that the worst offenders are talked about first, that way there’s some semblance of organization you can identify things with. If something sounds like a lesser issue, that’s because it probably is.\nThe friendly AI. Let’s make the distinction clear: The enemy AI and the friendly AI seem to be working on different rules here. I don’t know if it’s broken and doesn’t scale properly with difficulty, or if this was some sort of huge oversight. The enemy AI can drop you like a cripple that wandered into the middle of an ongoing war crime. But the friendly AI handles guns like a handicapped child with mommy issues. The friendly NPC’s are only even slightly competent when they’re scripted to be. To make this problem worse, not only do the majority of missions put you with an AI controlled squad (missions in which your assistance is very clearly accounted for with the size of enemy forces), but there are instances where you actually have to depend on this same terrible AI to cover you.\nHere’s a pretty good clip of that stellar friendly AI at work.\nI’ve personally witnessed the friendly AI kill an enemy… once. To clarify, that’s the average AI at work, not one of the many scripted moments where they wanna make a character look cool. We’ve had companions in shooters for around twenty years now, helpful ones even. How are we still having these problems? The terrible friendly AI in this game was easily the single largest negative drain on the entire experience. It’s that bad. Imagine having three to five enemies come up from behind you. Ya know, where your sixteen AI companions are sitting doing absolutely nothing. Real, earned deaths did happen. But the vast majority of the times I had to go back to a checkpoint, was because the friendly AI is entirely useless. From getting in my way, to just completely ignoring the enemy that just ran through a group of them. If the developers were to fix the AI, most of my issues with the game would be solved.\nFor the sake of transparency, here’s the one time I saw the AI actually manage to kill someone. Surprised me, so I recorded it.\nNext on the chopping block, is a mechanic called “mounting”. On paper, this is something I would’ve put in the list of positives. In practice… It just doesn’t work. Essentially: You’re “anchoring” or “leaning” your gun on an edge or corner, allowing you to pivot your aim around whatever it is you’re mounted on. A great idea for tactical, cautious gameplay. But for some reason, it just stops working at random, even when you’re not moving at all. This not only forces you to re-engage the mechanic, but it also screws up your aim and forces you out of cover. This is another thing that led to some of my cheap deaths. I like what they were trying to do, and even appreciate that they were attempting to do something different than other shooters with similar features. But in the end, I would’ve preferred a manual “lean” mechanic, like what can be found in Siege. As a way of enabling a more cautious playstyle, the game actually allows you to slowly push doors open instead of just bashing through them. It’s moments like this where a dedicated lean mechanic would’ve been very helpful as well.\nAnother problem I ran into every so often was enemy spawns. I don’t know any way to describe it simply. Sometimes enemies seem to spawn endlessly when there’s normally a set amount in any given mission. Endless enemy spawns, in a game with a lighting fast time to kill and useless companions. Imagine it for a moment. These endless spawns only seem to be stopped by walking forward just enough. One time, not only did they spawn endlessly in a small room, but they also ran down the exact same path every single time. It’s the only instance the enemy AI was anywhere near this stupid.\nHere’s a great clip showcasing not only the latter instance with enemy spawns, but also how finicky the “mount” mechanic can be.\nSo what’s up with the juggernaut? I wanted to put this complaint higher on the list, but it’s difficult to be more upset about this than other issues when there’s only one of these in the entire campaign (more in Spec Ops though). In the mission where it appears, the main NPC “Farah” suggests that I should grab the shotgun with dragon’s breath rounds. So when this guy popped up, I figured that must be the solution… right? Well quite a few deaths later and the game’s death message tells me that explosions stun him. They don’t. Not most of the time, anyway. Then the message told me to use stun grenades. These never worked for me. I tried launching underbarrel grenades at him, which were all duds apparently because none of them detonated (I actually watched some of them bounce off of him). Then Farah suggested I use the steam (which you release with a set piece mechanic) as cover and get behind him. That didn’t offer me much more advantage. Then I was told to shoot him in the head to stun him. You guessed it, I died because he wasn’t stunned. You can see where the problem here is, right? So after at least twenty deaths I got tired of dealing with it, and turned the difficulty as low as it could go so that I could deal with him.\nThis was the result.\nSo essentially, the game wants you to run around in circles with this guy who can practically instakill you because Infinity Ward thinks those little glass face shields can take sixty continuous high caliber rounds without breaking (remember, that’s how many it took on easy). He’s a bullet sponge. There’s no strategy, barely anything slows him down, and you just have to keep slamming your head against the wall until he falls over. I’m gonna be honest with you right here: I was debating whether or not to play the Spec Ops for this review. Because I knew it was gonna throw a bunch of these guys your way at once. Just one of them made me want to quit playing the game. It’s an atrocious, lazy enemy design. Do not put stat reliant challenges into realistic shooters. It doesn’t work. Even Breakpoint lets you knock their helmets off.\nIt’s worth noting that there are some annoying instances of some sort of mounted enemy (whether it be a sniper or gunner) that can’t be killed no matter what you do, unless you get behind them like the game wants you to. There was exactly one instance where I was actually allowed to kill one of these snipers with the use of an RPG I found (no, explosives don’t work any other time).\nA smaller, much more isolated issue occurred during a more scripted event. It’s practically nitpicking, but it bothered me. For some reason the game designers seemed to think there were only two possible options in a scenario, so it didn’t know how to react when I chose a third. So instead, it scolded me as if I chose the more merciless option.\nIt’s a simple thing, so I’ll let the clip speak for itself.\nA few minor things before we move on to multiplayer. The soundtrack was underwhelming. I know, most people don’t care. But I’m a sucker for a great, fitting soundtrack. The score composed by Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe for Modern Warfare 2 was iconic, it’s a shame we didn’t get something of that caliber here. There was one memorable track used in the final mission, and it’s used all the time during the final stretch of some multiplayer matches.\nAnother small problem I had was the occasional drastic frame rate drop. I’m playing on console (Xbox One), where the experience is supposed to be at the very least stable. So PC players may have even more occurrences. I also had one crash… Or more accurately, one place the game continuously crashed until I restarted the mission.\nIn mission number ten, “The Wolf’s Den”, you start out being dropped off by a helicopter. Immediately after getting your feet on the ground, you breach a building with two enemies inside - one in the middle of the first room, and another hiding further in. Upon loading the mission after a night’s sleep (a checkpoint which put me in right after the helicopter introduction), every time I killed the first enemy, the game would crash completely. Not just a freeze, straight to dashboard. This continued to happen until I restarted the mission entirely from the main menu.\nThe Multiplayer\nThe logical place to start I suppose would be with my favorite mode: Ground War. This is the multiplayer mode that intrigued me the most. I used to play Planetside 2. Not a perfect game by any means, but it did one thing very well. That one thing being emergent, organic gameplay. It’s the kind of game where I could share stories about how we held our ground for hours with no support, and no respawns. And how in that same instance, when some of the opposing players either got bored or had to go and the fighting calmed just a bit, I joined a small detachment with one goal: Head South and take over the area to reconnect with our territory and support. And that moment of tight player coordination after a long fight, finally gave us the win. So you can imagine when I heard about this mode in Modern Warfare that has teams of up to sixty four players fighting to take over a large map, I was extremely excited by it. It’s been some time since I’ve had a PC that could run Planetside 2, and I was thirsty for that kind of strategic battlefield gameplay.\nStrategy is indeed the name of the game here, it’s unfortunate many players can’t seem to wrap their heads around that. The team that doesn’t coordinate, is the team that loses. And I can’t entirely fault the playerbase for this one, as the game provides absolutely no quick effective methods of communication. Only the NPC voice droning on and on about the two players fighting a tug of war battle over the same point, or the occasional helpful warning about incoming enemy killstreaks. There’s voice chat of course, but first of all not everyone uses that for one reason or another, or even listens to it. I can’t for the life of me tell at a glance who’s talking either, I’m fairly certain I’ve never seen a “speaking” indicator over a teammate's head. What’s worse, is I could swear the game places a “radio” filter over the already greatly varying microphone quality. So voice communication is effectively useless.\nMany games have a lineup of “quick commands”, from Overwatch to For Honor. And that’s for a reason, team coordination is extremely important in online games. Not everyone has a huge clan that can not only fill up a team of sixty four, but also have sixty four working adults (or even busy teenagers) from different parts of the world on all at once.\nOn the topic of team communication, I can’t tell my teammates apart from enemies most of the time. It would be one thing if this were like real life, and everyone wore the same distinctive uniform. But this is a game where you can use skins of many characters from many different kinds of units, with two alternate color options for those characters. Not to mention you’re constantly switching sides. So why do I need to aim for several moments at an ally that’s wearing the exact same colors as one of the enemy team members (and probably shoot them, in a game with friendly fire), just to see the dark blue name tag appear above his head in the exact same way as enemies? I figure out who my teammates are from the fact that they haven’t shot me, faster than I see the indicator that they’re an ally. I never know if that’s an enemy tank I should be hiding from, or an ally tank I should be rallying behind. We’re talking about a game mode with huge environments and skyscrapers where sniping is a legitimately useful tactic. You need to know if that tan blob in the distance is one of yours, or one of theirs.\nSpeaking of ally markers, some of them are green, for some reason. Yeah most are blue, but some are green in ground war. Now I’m assuming this is meant to be some kind of “squad” mechanic, to encourage people to work together. But no one does it, and there’s no reason to (outside the obvious teamwork thing). You can respawn on them when they’re not in combat, and that’s about it. It’s handy, but with no incentive at all to work together, why should anyone bother working with those teammates over others? Perhaps if there was a kind of XP boost or something, the mechanic would encourage the less coordinated players to assist each other. It’s arguably more beneficial to split up so that everyone can basically spawn wherever they’re needed. Spawning on the ally who’s standing where you just got ripped apart is usually suicide anyway. The only time it’s helpful, is when a few people from your squad all decide they wanna be snipers. In these instances, you can actually use it to your advantage. Watch each other’s backs, share field upgrades, and respawn on each other when one of you gets picked off.\nVery rarely is a control point inside a building. It’s usually in the middle of some field or a connecting bridge. Working with your squad in a hold out is almost never an option, so sniper teams are the only players that really benefit. Which is odd, because the map design here is great! Every building can be entered, and the few doors that can’t be opened are very clearly barred. There are numerous entry points on every building. Your options for breaching and defending these interiors are just as diverse. I can’t think of any logical reason these control points were placed in such blatant killzones. I get having a few, maybe make every center point open? But when most of them are nothing more than mosh pits, almost all strategy goes out the window. You either get there first and use a clever trick to hold it, or you take it by sheer brute force (usually involving vehicles, or a lot of explosives and players when indoors).\nI didn’t plan to start talking about most of my problems with multiplayer during the bit about Ground War, but it just so happens to be the mode where the flaws are most apparent. However like I said, it’s my favorite mode, despite these issues. I actually had to stop myself from playing it to try the other modes for this review. There are still many instances of genuine teamwork and battlefield strategy. There’s nothing more satisfying than being a member of the team that’s holding the control point inside the cramped barn, other than being on the team that finally gets in that is. Some points are fought with small skirmishes, others are lit up with intense combat. Helicopter attacks, tanks, jets, airstrikes. They all make for quite the spectacle in Ground War.\nPlanetside 2 had massive, expansive open world maps dotted with everything fortresses to outposts, and designed solely for that kind of freeform gameplay. Ground War maps are obviously smaller, and naturally offer a few less options. They’d basically be making a whole new game to pull that off. Even so, Modern Warfare could stand to benefit from taking some notes. Put a few more of those control points in fortified areas (like any competent military would), make players strategize together to flush out their opponents. Not all of them, just don’t make open points the norm either. It would solve the problem of sniper teams being the dominant strategy. It would also give less equipped new players the chance to be more useful.\nGround War may not quite be Planetside 2, but it certainly scratches the itch. I’m frankly not very good at it right now. But after a fair bit of play, I was taking out snipers at long range with my light machine gun in Planetside 2. So maybe it’s only a matter of time.\n“Gunfight” is next on the list of multiplayer modes. I personally got tired of it pretty quick. But that’s not to say it’s bad, to the contrary in fact. I just don’t much enjoy that sort of area shooter combat. I can however appreciate it’s laser focused goal. Two teams of two players, a tiny arena, no killstreaks, and a random loadout (that everyone shares). It’s the purest form of competition. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t find it exciting at times. It’s simplicity also doesn’t offer a lot for me to say about it. It’s good. If you like quick snappy competitive modes, you’ll like Gunfight.\nThis is where I actually expected my critique to get a bit disorganized. There are two modes, “Shoot House 24/7” and “Hardpoint”. Both are equally bizarre names to me, as neither of them give you any kind of indication as to what the modes actually are. On top of that, they’re both the exact same game mode. There’s a difference between them, sure. But it’s negligible at best. What’s even more odd, is that Shoot House is a post launch release, with one map (currently). They put time and effort to making the same mode again (but slightly worse), and a map for this mode, and labeled it as “content”. Free content sure, but that doesn’t negate what a waste of time it was.\nBoth of these modes revolve around taking over control points (innovative, I know). It’s one control point, cycling to different locations across the map every so often. There is literally, only one legitimate difference between the modes. In Shoot House, you’re taking over points that have invisible barriers. In Hardpoint, you’re taking over points that have visible barriers. That’s it. That’s the only difference. The points on the one Shoot House map are always outside, whereas the ones in Hardpoint tend to be inside. Note that I said “tend to be”. Some of the Hardpoint control points are outside as well, so not even that can be considered a difference.\nIf I’m being frank, Harpoint comes out on top as the better of the two variants. Notably in fact. First of all, there’s no reason we shouldn’t know where the barriers of the control point are. In Shoot House, you have to waste time feeling around for the mystical elusive finish line (this is an issue Ground War suffers from as well). Knowing where those boundaries are allows you to immediately and wordlessly coordinate a defensive strategy with your team. And with the perk of most of these points being inside, it makes for quite the intense game of take over, and hold out. With the maps being so small and the objectives so pinpoint, great teamwork is actually very prevalent in this mode.\nEven when objectives are out in the open, the awareness of borders allows for better planning. Often times a single player or two will sit on the point to hold it, while the rest of the team sets up at choke points and sniping positions. This too is very satisfying and exciting. Amazing, the drastic difference a simple touch makes. Hardpoint is actually my second favorite mode, and I’m actually pretty decent at it.\nLast on the list, is “Free for All”. It’s Free for All. I feel bad for giving it such a small word count in a review, but what do you want me to say? I would never have played it if I wasn’t writing this. I almost didn’t anyway. I knew what it was gonna be, and I knew I wouldn’t like it. I think I’ve made it pretty clear I’m not really interested in that sort of gameplay. The only time I’ve ever actually enjoyed a free for all mode, was in Overwatch. And that’s more down to the variety it’s characters bring. It’s Gunfight without any of the balance or creativity. It’s not bad, it’s just Free for All. If you mess up Free for All, you shouldn’t be making multiplayer games. Bring a shotgun or an SMG and you’re bound to get some kills. If you like that sort of gameplay, you’ll probably enjoy it. Just don’t be surprised when people start breaking out their automated turret killstreaks and set claymores on staircases for easy kills.\nLet’s end this on a good note, shall we?\nFirst of all, I’d like to compliment the game on it’s weapon customization. It’s decently expansive, and everything is earned. You can change your reticle, paint, even slap some stickers on there screw it. Attachments don’t have completely nonsense drawbacks, like how most games make suppressors decrease power and range despite the fact that they’re a barrel extension. In fact, they work exactly as they should, extending your range. There are an odd few with attributes that don’t really make sense, but this would seem to be the exception.\nWeapons level up seperately, a mechanic you’d be familiar with if you play Titanfall 2. I’m not particularly a fan, as this means you’re essentially punished with more difficult gameplay because you’re new. But at least they’re not making you buy this stuff. If fact, they don’t let you buy anything in the multiplayer, not even boosters to skip the grind. There’s a store page, and the only thing on there right now is a charity related cosmetic pack. I don’t know who sacrificed what, but I appreciate it.\nThere’s also some character customization. Now don’t get too excited, you won’t be making a tactical waifu in this game. But there’s a decent selection of characters, all with three different skins to choose from. They can earned through various tasks and challenges. Again, no real money purchases here. It’s not much, but it’s appreciated.\nSpecial Operations (Co-Op)\nI tried, I really did. Despite the fact that I knew there’d be numerous Juggernauts, I didn’t feel right putting out a review of this game without playing the Spec Ops missions. Unfortunately, I really can’t dig too deep into them. Let me be crystal clear: I have only played the Spec Ops missions, I haven’t completed a single one. That’s because of two major factors: It’s a team reliant mode, and I have no friends to play with. Oh sure, I can play with random parties, and I did. But there’s almost no one who actually works together, everyone wants to run to objectives. And when we fail once or twice as a result, someone always quits, forcing everyone else to restart the mission. If I were to hold up this review to play through Spec Ops, it might very well take the rest of the month. So instead, I’ll tell you what I can. Don’t expect much.\nI was actually pleasantly surprised by the setup of Spec Ops missions. First of all, your multiplayer unlocks and loadouts carry over (and vice versa). So playing one doesn’t impede your progress in other. Even killstreaks appear as equippable gear. Once you’re all set and a mission is chosen, you’re dropped into a sizable level to complete various objectives in, much like my favorite missions in single player. One even gives you the option to infiltrate a base quietly (of course no one did that).\nHonestly, a coordinated team could take these missions on, even with the annoying Juggernauts (those are still very bad here). It’s just a lack of the former that makes these as difficult as the are. It’s even more of a shame, because the story in these is a continuation of the campaign. These honestly seem like great fun to me, I just can’t play them right now.\nConclusion\nModern Warfare is not a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a good one. Above average I’d say. There are quite a few things to legitimately enjoy here, and amazing potential for ideration. The story is solid, and fun. Surprising and gut wrenching at times. The gunplay is exactly what ten years of annual releases should be. Tight, polished and satisfying. Unfortunately, there are also a few genuine glaring problems in places there really shouldn’t be. Either fix the friendly AI, or get them out of my way. There is no excuse for the companions you’re supposed to depend on being useless. There is no excuse for a bullet sponge enemy. There is no excuse for a complete disregard of all logic and reason.\nGame developers should know by now that no one can read the dark colored small text above a person’s head. I should not have to struggle to comprehend the name of the person I’m trying to communicate with. I need to be able to point my teammate in the right direction with a command at a moment’s notice. There is no good reason for these basic things to be wrong.\nAt the same time, this is a game I’ve been enjoying my time with. I hope they fix these issues going forward, because I haven’t been excited to play a Call of Duty game in a long time. It wasn’t a chore to play this for a review, I had fun with it. Even more in the multiplayer. And that’s really weird for me, I’m a PVE and single player type. I almost never thoroughly enjoy competitive games. And when I do, it’s usually racing and fighting games, not first person shooters. This game is an outlier, and I actually want to keep playing it. I sincerely hope they don’t squander what they’ve built here.\n","date":"2021-02-20","id":10,"permalink":"/blog/modern-warfare-review/","summary":"(DISCLAIMER: This is an archived article from my time at the gaming/pop-culture website \"Escape Zero\".
